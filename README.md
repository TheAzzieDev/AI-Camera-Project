# SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM PROJECT üõ°Ô∏è
This Project was made a while back to test a concept I had been working on where a security camera would be given object detection capabillities,
to incapacitate any intruders. There was alot of trail and error with 3d printing but no progress has been made on the hardware side, so
project status is currently inactive.

#### RUNNING THE APPPLICATION
Before running the application install the necessary dependancies:
```pip install requirments.txt```
To run the application use the command:
```flask --app panel run --debug ```
The frame rate can be slow when accessing the camera so please be patient
